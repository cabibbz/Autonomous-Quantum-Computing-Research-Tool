## QPU Budget
- Monthly allocation: 600 seconds
- Used this period: 0s
- Period start: 2026-03-31

## Constraints (learned the hard way)
- **Max qubits for partial_trace: 10.** Beyond that, CPU time explodes.
- **Max bash command runtime: 60 seconds.** Design experiments to fit.
- **Save results after EACH experiment.** Never batch.
- **Separate scripts per experiment.** One timeout shouldn't kill everything.

## Sprint Log

### Sprint 001 — 2026-03-31 — Bell States & CHSH
**Status:** Partial (2/4 experiments; GHZ scaling timed out)

**Completed:**
- Verified all 4 Bell states: perfect correlations, entropy = 1.0 bit
- CHSH inequality: **S = 2.834** (violates classical bound of 2.0, matches Tsirelson bound 2.828)

**Failed:**
- GHZ entropy scaling (n>15 qubits): partial_trace too slow on CPU
- Random vs GHZ entropy: same issue

**Surprises:**
- CHSH angles are subtle: wrong Bob angles give S=0 even though individual correlations look correct
- Simulator is very accurate for small circuits (S matches theory to 3 decimals at 100k shots)

**Next:** Map CHSH violation landscape, explore noise effects, small-scale entanglement comparison
